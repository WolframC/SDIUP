\section{Conclusion}
We report that using spectrophotometry to determine iron of micro even trace quantity is effective and meets the requirements of green chemistry. And we apply orthogonal experimental design to optimize the combination of some factors. Meanwhile, we knew the ratio of phen and iron in the complex is 3:1 and drew to a conclusion that molar ratio method is more general and effective in determine composition of coordinary compound. Then we plotted a standard curve, with which we can predict the concentration of iron in unknown sample. The result is very accurate, which is validated by measuring the purity of \ce{FeC2O4}$\cdot$2\ce{H2O}. Most importantly, the chromoginice agent can be specifically chosen in various conditions so spectrophotometry can be widely applied to diverse ions of diverse quantity.
